 <H1> A poem about cat</H1> 
Whisker Twilight

In the hush between the lamps and moon,

a shadow curls, then stretches thin—

paws like whispers crossing the room,

eyes lit with lanterns burning within.

The night bends softly around her tread,

each step a secret the dark won’t tell;

she carries the silence where dreams are fed,

and leaves in her wake a silver spell.<p>.</p>
